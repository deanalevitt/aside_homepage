      <h1>Aside Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We regard your privacy seriously and this Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and the circumstances under which we may share it.
This Privacy Policy governs your (the “User,” also referred to herein as “you” or “your” or “Customer”) use of the Aside website and browser extension (collectively, the “Service”) operated by Aside (“we,” “our” or “us").</p>
      <p>Aside has three different types of Users, depending on how you interact with the Service. It is possible that you may use Aside in different ways. If so, please review all applicable terms.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Guests</span>. We call users who use a non-paid version of the Service, “Guests.” Aside is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Guests.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Site Visitors</span>. We call users of the Website “Site Visitors.” Site Visitors can be individuals who are simply browsing the Websites but who do not use the Service. Site Visitors can also be Guests who visit the Websites to seek additional information about Aside. Aside is the data controller of the information collected through the Website about Site Visitors.</p>
      <h2>Privacy Terms for Guests</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This section of this Policy applies only to Guests. If you are a Guest located in the European Union, Aside is the data controller with respect to the processing of your personal data pursuant to the GDPR.</p>
      <h3>Collection and Use of Guest Information</h3>
      <p>This section explains the information we collect from Guests. We do not require Guests to provide us with information. However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>
      <p class="bullet">1. <span>User Content</span>. The messages, content, user names, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“User Content”).</p>
      <p class="bullet">2. <span>Account Information</span>. Information you provide as part of your account registration with Aside, which may include your name, address, IP address, email address, username and password; optional information that you may choose to provide, such as a photograph or basic demographic data; and, with your permission, calendar information that you may elect to upload to your account (collectively, the “Account Information”).</p>
      <p class="bullet">3. <span>Service Usage Information</span>. As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”). Such information includes:</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Device information – when you access the Service, we collect certain device information, including the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files. These log files may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, date and time stamp information, language preferences, data from cookies and similar technologies, and other such information.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Account Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Account. For example, we may log the number of Accounts you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; and the types of files you share.</p>
      <p class="bullet">4. <span>Other Information</span>. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).</p>
      <h3>How Does Aside Use Guest Information?</h3>
      <p>This section describes how Aside uses the information we collect from Guests.</p>

We use Google Analytics to locate usage across devices and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">you may opt out of this by clicking here</a>.</p>
      <h3>Legal Bases for Use of Your Information</h3>

      <h2>Privacy Terms for Site Visitors</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This Section of this Policy applies only to Site Visitors. If you visit the Website, regardless of whether you are also a user of the Service, the following rules apply to you. To eliminate any confusion, please note that the terms in this section apply only to use of Aside’s Websites, not to use of the Service. If you are a Site Visitor located in the European Union, Aside is the data controller with respect to the processing of your personal data pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>
      <h3>Collection and Use of Site Visitor Information</h3>
      <p>This section explains the information we collect from Site Visitors.</p>
      <p class="bullet">1. <span>Information Collected from Site Visitors</span>.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Contact Information. If you submit a request for information or a question through the Websites, you may be asked to provide us with basic information including your name, email address, phone number, and postal address. We will also keep records of the communication, the question/request you raised, and how it was resolved.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Websites Usage Information. As you browse the Websites, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf to provide and enhance the Websites) use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting information about how you use the Websites. For example, our servers automatically record certain information in server logs. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Websites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, mobile device identifiers and information about the device you are using to access the Websites, date and time stamp information and other such information.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Location Information. We collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</p>
      <p class="bullet">2. <span>Cookies and Similar Technologies</span>. We and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand which pages of the Websites you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods. Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).</p>
      <p class="bullet">3. <span>Use of Information Collected from Site Visitors</span>. We use the information collected from Site Visitors for a variety of purposes including to:</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Maintain, provide, and improve the Websites and the Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Respond to your requests for information</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; In accordance with applicable legal obligations, communicate with you about promotions, offers, and news about Aside. You have the ability to unsubscribe from such promotional communications</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Prevent or address technical or security issues</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Investigate in good faith alleged violations of our User Terms of Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Help us better understand Site Visitor interests and needs, and customize the advertising and content you see on the Websites</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Engage in analysis and research regarding use of the Website and the Service</p>
      <h3>Legal Bases for Use of Your Information</h3>
      <p>If you are located in the EU, please note that the legal bases under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) for using the information we collect through your use of the Website as a Site Visitor are as follows:</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with the Terms of Service which you accept by browsing the Website)</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; Where use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our Website; operate our Website; prevent fraud, analyze use of and improve our Website, and for similar purposes)</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; Where use of your information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; Where we have your consent to process data in a certain way</p>
      <h3>Aggregate De-Identified Data</h3>
      <p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Website so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and analytics, and may also share such data with any third parties, including partners, affiliates, services providers, and others.</p>
      <h3>Combined Information</h3>
      <p>We may combine the information that we collect through the Service with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Policy and, if you’re a Subscriber or User, in accordance with the Terms of Service.</p>
      <h3>Website Analytics and Advertising</h3>
      <p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Websites to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">you may opt out of this by clicking here</a> to install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>
      <p>The Website may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Websites, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>
      <p>We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Websites. We sometimes provide Site Visitor information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites.</p>
      <p>We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Websites by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings page</a>. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
      <p>Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Websites, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p>
      <h3>Sharing of Site Visitor Information</h3>
      <p>We may share the information we collect from Site Visitors as follows:</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Service Providers</span>. We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties that use the information only to perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation provision of content and features, analytics, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and other services.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Business Transactions</span>. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the Service can continue to operate. In such case, your information would remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Policy until such time as the acquiring party modifies it. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Aside will comply with such restrictions.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Consent</span>. We may also disclose your information to third parties with your consent to do so.</p>
      <h3>Retention of Your Information</h3>
      <p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>
      <h3>Data Subject Rights</h3>
      <p>Local legal requirements (such as those in the EU) may afford you additional rights. If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us via email at any time at support@aside.earth. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p>
      <p>Your local laws (such as those in the EU) may permit you to request that we:</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; provide access to and/or a copy of certain information we hold about you</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; prevent the processing of your information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling)</p>

Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
      <h3>Third Party Links And Services</h3>
      <p>The Website may contain links to third-party websites and functionalities. If you choose to use these third party services, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Aside, Aside is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We recommend you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.</p>
      <h2>General Privacy Terms for All Users</h2>
      <h3>What Information is collected and how is it used?</h3>
      <p>Aside collects Personal Information in the course of providing the Service to you, including through your voluntary, optional submissions, such as information that you provide to us at the time of registering for the Service, or through your use of the Service. When you register with us for an account, we may collect information such as your name and email address. When you pay for certain features of the Service, we may collect information such as your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and CVV or security code number. You may also provide Personal Information to us in other ways, such as by requesting user support.</p>
      <p>We do not store any of your financial information including billing and credit card information. Your financial information is processed by secure, third party services.</p>
      <p>We will never sell nor rent your personal information to any third party. We may use your email address to deliver relevant product information and marketing messages. You may opt-out from receiving these marketing messages by following the instructions provided in the messages to unsubscribe from email communication or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@aside.earth">support@aside.earth</a>. Communication about important notices and updates regarding the Service, such as to inform you about changes in the Service, and important services-related notices, such as about security and fraud are an important part of the Service, and you may not opt out of them.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to use the name and/or logo of the company you work for in publicity material, advertising or marketing collateral, unless you specifically tell us otherwise. Your full name, address details and all other personal information will remain confidential at all times.</p>
      <p>The Site uses cookies to store information on your computer which are necessary for the proper operation of our system and help us improve the user experience. By using Aside, you consent to the placement of these cookies. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. We use this information to help, diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the Site and the Service. We also gather anonymized information from this data to help us improve the Site and Service. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>
      <h3>Disclosure of Information</h3>
      <p><span class="bold">Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</span>. We may use Non-Personal Information that we collect to (a) provide, improve, and develop the Service and otherwise tailor your user experience, (b) prevent or investigate fraudulent or inappropriate usage of our Service, and (c) conduct research and development, and for the other purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">Service Providers</span>. We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Site and Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used. These third parties have access to your personally identifiable information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</span>. Aside cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Aside or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>

      <p><span class="bold">Account Information</span>. You agree to keep confidential and not to disclose to any other individual or individuals for all time the username and password related to Your Aside account.</p>
      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>In an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Please be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.
