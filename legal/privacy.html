      <h1>Aside Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>We regard your privacy seriously and this Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how we collect it, how we use it and the circumstances under which we may share it.
This Privacy Policy governs your (the “User,” also referred to herein as “you” or “your” or “Customer”) use of the Aside website and browser extension (collectively, the “Service”) operated by Aside (“we,” “our” or “us").</p>
      <p>Aside has three different types of Users, depending on how you interact with the Service. It is possible that you may use Aside in different ways. If so, please review all applicable terms.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Guests</span>. We call users who use a non-paid version of the Service, “Guests.” Aside is the data controller of the information collected through the Service about Guests.</p>
      <p class="bullet">&#9900; <span>Site Visitors</span>. We call users of the Website “Site Visitors.” Site Visitors can be individuals who are simply browsing the Websites but who do not use the Service. Site Visitors can also be Guests who visit the Websites to seek additional information about Aside. Aside is the data controller of the information collected through the Website about Site Visitors.</p>
      <h2>Privacy Terms for Guests</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>This section of this Policy applies only to Guests. If you are a Guest located in the European Union, Aside is the data controller with respect to the processing of your personal data pursuant to the GDPR.</p>
      <h3>Collection and Use of Guest Information</h3>
      <p>This section explains the information we collect from Guests. We do not require Guests to provide us with information. However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>
      <p class="bullet">1. <span>User Content</span>. The messages, content, user names, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“User Content”).</p>
      <p class="bullet">2. <span>Account Information</span>. Information you provide as part of your account registration with Aside, which may include your name, address, IP address, email address, username and password; optional information that you may choose to provide, such as a photograph or basic demographic data; and, with your permission, calendar information that you may elect to upload to your account (collectively, the “Account Information”).</p>
      <p class="bullet">3. <span>Service Usage Information</span>. As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”). Such information includes:</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Device information – when you access the Service, we collect certain device information, including the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files. These log files may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, date and time stamp information, language preferences, data from cookies and similar technologies, and other such information.</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Account Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Account. For example, we may log the number of Accounts you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; and the types of files you share.</p>
      <p class="bullet">4. <span>Other Information</span>. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).</p>
      <h3>How Does Aside Use Guest Information?</h3>
      <p>This section describes how Aside uses the information we collect from Guests.</p>
      <p class="bullet">1. User Content. Aside may view and use User Content collected from and about Subscribers only as necessary:</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; To maintain, provide and improve the Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; To prevent or address technical or security issues and resolve support requests</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; To investigate when we have a good faith belief, or have received a complaint alleging, that such User Content is in violation of the Terms of Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; To comply with a valid legal subpoena, request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of the Customer Agreement and our Law Enforcement Guidelines</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; As otherwise set forth in our Terms of Service or as expressly permitted in writing by the Customer</p>
      <p class="bullet">2. <span>Account Information</span>, Service Usage Information, Information from Third Party Integrations, and Other Information. Aside may use these categories of information collected from and about Subscribers to:</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Maintain, provide, and improve the Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Respond to your requests for information</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Prevent or address technical or security issues and resolve support requests</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Investigate in good faith alleged violations of our User Terms of Service</p>
      <p class="indentBullet">&#9900; Comply with a valid legal subpoena, request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of our Law Enforcement Guidelines</p>
